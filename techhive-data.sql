Storage	Solid-State Drives (SSDs) and Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) are two common types of storage devices. SSDs use flash memory to store data, making them faster, quieter, and more durable as they have no moving parts. They are energy-efficient and ideal for quick data access. In contrast, HDDs rely on spinning magnetic disks to read and write data. While they are slower and more fragile due to their moving components, they are more cost-effective for large storage capacities, making them a budget-friendly option for extensive data storage.	\N	9adc8466-11d2-4324-81f3-32053c72c8f8	\N
PC Cases	A PC case, also known as a computer case, computer chassis, or cabinet, is the outer shell of a computer that protects its internal components and accessories	\N	088d9db2-4bbb-4dd8-a5a8-1267f765451e	\N
Graphics Cards	A graphics card, also known as a video card or graphics processing unit (GPU), is a hardware component that processes and displays images, videos, and animations on a computer monitor.	\N	c9a88dfd-a264-4d67-b030-f69ebc2ba2da	\N
